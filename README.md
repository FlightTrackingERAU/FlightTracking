# Flight Tracking ERAU SE300

## Description

Software that allows for weather and plane tracking to facilitate the user in looking at plane paths. Many people who choose flights are forced to change flights or wait, when then get canceled or delayed due to weather. For some people it is fine but those who have deadlines would want to avoid this. Buy allowing flights and weather to be tracked it is possible for the user to avoid these delays and flight cancelations.
